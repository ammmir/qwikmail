Q: What is it?
A: It is an SMTP (mail) server that supports SMTP and ESMTP. Once finished,
   it will be very secure, hopefully with the same reputation as qmail.

It supports the following standards:
- minimal SMTP compliance; full SMTP compliance coming, and rudimentary ESMTP
  compliance still in the works
- supports delivery to either mbox files or Maildirs

QwikMail SMTP server
 part of the Qwik SQL Webmail Server project
