qwik-smtpd is a small mail server that supports ESMTP, and aims at being
a replacement for sendmail, postfix, and Qmail. Its strengths include
simplicity, speed, security, and size. It is part of the QwikMail
mail system package. It is written in C that is hoped to be portable,
so it should compile on any ANSI C compiler, but requires a POSIX-compliant
system for all the bells and whistles.

qwik-smtpd takes no part in the delivery of the actual mail, it merely
accepts mail and places it into a queue. The mail delivery agent (MDA),
qwik-deliver, delivers items in the queue to their respective locations,
such as mbox files, Maildirs, or remote mail servers.

qwik-smtpd is a part of the QwikMail project, which is located at
http://qwikmail.sourceforge.net/

Should you have any questions, comments, or criticisms, please don't hesitate
to contact me at amir142 at sourceforge dot net. Thanks for using QwikMail!
