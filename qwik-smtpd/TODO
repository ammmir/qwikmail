- rethink the alarm() calls in the code to make sure that the timeouts
  actually work!
- minimize warning messages during compilation
- configuration script, which asks the admin for values and automatically
  creates/updates the config files; aka an "installer" for the server
- add some more ESMTP support, maybe some pipelining, etc.
- add spam control or virus checking abilities after message has been sent;
  such as running an external program to check if the message is spam, and
  tell the server if the mail is acceptable or not
- MD5 hashing/logging of messages
