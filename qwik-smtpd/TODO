qwik-smtpd TODO
---------------

$Date: 2004-11-18 05:51:25 $
$Revision: 1.17 $

- introduce functions for all SMTP verbs
- reduce global variable pollution
- run chkusr during RCPT TO command; it will tell us: a) accept/deny this
  envelope request, b) possible forwarding address, c) tempfail it for
  a greylisting-type setup
- introduce a tarpit delay to RCPT TO commands
- check MX record for domain given in HELO/EHLO (async dns lookup)
- add something like /etc/aliases or equivalent
- add relaying, maybe a relayhosts file, that has IP addresses of hosts that
  are allowed to relay mail through us
- add a _lot_ of error checking in qwik-smtpd:
  - readability/writeability of files (config, queue, etc.)
  - disk space/memory
  - NFS-safe writes; check bytes written, etc.
  - load average
- add some more ESMTP support, maybe some pipelining, etc.
- add virus checking abilities after message has been sent and/or during
  an SMTP transaction
- MD5 hashing/logging of messages
- add a relay count hopper... so that we don't infinitely loop messages!!!
- add support for IPv6
- bullet-proof test qwik-deliver.pl so that it works all around; remove fork()
