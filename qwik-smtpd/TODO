$Revision: 1.5 $

- fix problem with rcpthosts file; a newline is required at the end for parsing
- add relaying, maybe a relayhosts file, that has IP addresses of hosts that
  are allowed to relay mail through us
- bullet-proof test qwik-deliver.pl so that it works all around
- add a _lot_ of error checking in qwik-smtpd:
  - readability/writeability of files (config, queue, etc.)
  - disk space/memory
  - NFS-safe writes; check bytes written, etc.
- minimize warning messages during compilation
- configuration script, which asks the admin for values and automatically
  creates/updates the config files; aka an "installer" for the server
- add some more ESMTP support, maybe some pipelining, etc.
- add spam control or virus checking abilities after message has been sent;
  such as running an external program to check if the message is spam, and
  tell the server if the mail is acceptable or not
- MD5 hashing/logging of messages
