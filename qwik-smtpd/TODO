qwik-smtpd TODO
---------------

$Date: 2002-06-28 05:29:19 $
$Revision: 1.9 $

- FIX the stupid Makefile
- fix problem with rcpthosts file; a newline is required at the end for parsing
  (not a big deal... might scare some sysadmins at first)
- add something like /etc/aliases or equivalent
- add relaying, maybe a relayhosts file, that has IP addresses of hosts that
  are allowed to relay mail through us
- bullet-proof test qwik-deliver.pl so that it works all around; remove fork()
- add a _lot_ of error checking in qwik-smtpd:
  - readability/writeability of files (config, queue, etc.)
  - disk space/memory
  - NFS-safe writes; check bytes written, etc.
- minimize warning messages during compilation
- configuration script, which asks the admin for values and automatically
  creates/updates the config files; aka an "installer" for the server
- add some more ESMTP support, maybe some pipelining, etc.
- add virus checking abilities after message has been sent and/or during
  an SMTP transaction
- MD5 hashing/logging of messages
- add a relay count hopper... so that we don't infinitely loop messages!!!
