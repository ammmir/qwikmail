0.1
---

- first official release
- supports minimal ESMTP functionality, except that it does not "send" mail,
  it uses an external program, such as sendmail to actually send mail, but
  it does gracefully receive mail!
- supports both mbox and Maildir formats; although Maildir is preferred
- very primitive "selective" relaying; need to change source code; this will
  be changed in the next release
