0.4

- fixed "the stupid Makefile." make, make clean, and make install now work

0.3
---

- added a qmail-like checkpassword for checking RCPTs with host; will give
  error if user is not on host
- improved checkpassword; added primitive support for .forward file users'
  homedirs, which would result the daemon to spit out a 251 SMTP code for
  forwarding mail
- reworked RCPT TO code
- added /etc/qwik-smtpd/blacklists ... a file with the format:
  server,errormsg
  example:
  relays.ordb.org,Your IP has been blacklisted.
  the checkpassword program checks (for each recipient, albeit VERY slow if
  you have 10 RCPTs!) the IP in each blacklist, until a match is found;
  it loops until all servers have been searched, and if none found, then
  continues
- updated mailbomb.pl for more options and better UI (added time counting :)
- ESMTP EHLO now reports the correct SIZE (max_message_size) instead of 0

0.2
---

- cleaned up qwik-deliver.pl and qwik-smtpd.c
- removed unused config struct from server
- added stuff against relaying; checks for ! character
- added qmail-like "rcpthosts" config file; contains \n-separated list of
  domains to accept mail for
- anti-spamming feature added: 1 second delay if number of RCPTs is greater
  than half the value of max_recipients or if greater than MAX_FAST_RCPTS
- if the message size is greater than what is allowed, the data file is
  deleted using unlink()
- changed distribution from qwikmail-smtpd to qwik-smtpd

0.1
---

- first official release
- supports minimal ESMTP functionality, except that it does not "send" mail,
  it uses an external program, such as sendmail to actually send mail, but
  it does gracefully receive mail!
- supports both mbox and Maildir formats; although Maildir is preferred
- very primitive "selective" relaying; need to change source code; this will
  be changed in the next release
