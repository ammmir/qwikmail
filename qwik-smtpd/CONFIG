Configuration Files
-------------------

In qwik-smtpd's configuration file directory (eg. /etc/qwik-smtpd),
you can add any of the following files with the appropriate content
and qwik-smtpd will use the configuration value present in that file
instead of its default value. Just in case you are curious what the
defaults are, you can look at the config.h source file.

At the moment, you MUST have two files in that directory, the localip
and localhost configration files.


Parameters

localip              local IP address of machine;
                      TODO: make this auto detected
localhost            accept mail for this domain;
                      TODO: accept mail for >1 domain
smtpgreeting         will default to localhost config
                      value if not set; eg., MyDomain
                      will cause the daemon to output:
                      220 MyDomain SMTP service ready
