To install:

Latest documentation:
http://qwikmail.sourceforge.net/smtpd/

1. note this: this server has not been tested in a production environment
2. edit "config.h" and look over the defaults and change some of them if
   you want to; configuration files will override any of the compiled-in
   defaults, so if you want less config files to worry about, edit the
   defaults!
3. `make` (compiles programs)
4. `grep "MODIFY THIS" * ` (returns a list of locations in files where you
   will need to edit some variables to suit your needs; just config vars)
5. su root (becomes superuser)
6. make install (creates queue dirs, copies files, etc.)
7. read the file CONFIG, and create/modify the appropriate files in the
   configuration directory
8. useradd qwikmail -d /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
9. groupadd qwikmail
0. do this:
    chown -R qwikmail:qwikmail /etc/qwik-smtpd
    chown -R qwikmail:qwikmail /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
    chmod -R u+rw /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
    chmod -R og-rw /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
   where `qwikmail' is the name of your mail user/group.

IF YOUR ARE USING INETD:
1. add the following line in /etc/inetd.conf:
   smtp  stream  tcp  nowait.200  qwikmail /usr/local/sbin/qwik-smtpd  qsmtpd
   note: inetd will limit 200 connections to this service per minute
2. killall -HUP inetd

IF YOU ARE USING XINETD:
1. add the following lines to /etc/xinetd.conf:
    service smtp
    {
      flags = REUSE
      socket_type = stream
      protocol = tcp
      wait = no
      user = qwikmail
      server = /usr/local/sbin/qwik-smtpd
    }
2. killall -HUP xinetd


3. telnet localhost 25 (and test it out!)


Hopefully, it works...
Please note that QwikMail SMTP is not a full mail system since it lacks a
major component, the ability to send mail to other sites without using an
external program such as the sendmail binary. But don't worry, it will
soon be, as the development of such a component is already under way.
