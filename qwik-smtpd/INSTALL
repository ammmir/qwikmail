quickie install
---------------

- edit config.h and set the DEFAULTS!!
- run make
- if ok, run make install
  - or do it the MANUAL way:
    - mkdir /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
    - mkdir /var/spool/qwik-smtpd/control
    - mkdir /var/spool/qwik-smtpd/messages
    - mkdir /etc/qwik-smtpd
    - and now copy some stuff/config files there
    - copy checkpassword to its appropriate location
- look over the files in /etc/qwik-smtpd
- append the content of the included inetd.conf or xinetd.conf to your
  appropriate file in /etc
- change permissions to /var/spool/qwik-smtpd to match your qwik-smtpd
  user that you specified in your inetd.conf or xinetd.conf
- killall -HUP inetd or killall -HUP xinetd
- cd /home/qwik-smtpd
- grep "MODIFY THIS" qwik-deliver.pl
- make the necessary changes to qwik-deliver.pl and finally,
- /home/qwik-smtpd/qwik-deliver.pl

- now everything should be running smoothly, assuming that your config
  is set up right... either /var/spool/mail or /home/USER/Maildir setups
  are working correctly
- test it out like so:

telnet YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_NOT_LOCALHOST 25

1. note this: this server has not been tested in a production environment
2. edit "config.h" and look over the defaults and change some of them if
   you want to; configuration files will override any of the compiled-in
   defaults, so if you want less config files to worry about, edit the
   defaults!
3. `make` (compiles programs)
4. `grep "MODIFY THIS" * ` (returns a list of locations in files where you
   will need to edit some variables to suit your needs; just config vars)
5. su root (becomes superuser)
6. make install (creates queue dirs, copies files, etc.)
7. read the file CONFIG, and create/modify the appropriate files in the
   configuration directory
8. useradd qwikmail -d /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
9. groupadd qwikmail
0. do this:
    chown -R qwikmail:qwikmail /etc/qwik-smtpd
    chown -R qwikmail:qwikmail /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
    chmod -R u+rw /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
    chmod -R og-rw /var/spool/qwik-smtpd
   where `qwikmail' is the name of your mail user/group.

IF YOUR ARE USING INETD:
1. add the following line in /etc/inetd.conf:
   smtp  stream  tcp  nowait.200  qwikmail /usr/local/sbin/qwik-smtpd  qsmtpd
   note: inetd will limit 200 connections to this service per minute
2. killall -HUP inetd

IF YOU ARE USING XINETD:
1. add the following lines to /etc/xinetd.conf:
    service smtp
    {
      flags = REUSE
      socket_type = stream
      protocol = tcp
      wait = no
      user = qwikmail
      server = /usr/local/sbin/qwik-smtpd
    }
2. killall -HUP xinetd


3. telnet localhost 25 (and test it out!)


Hopefully, it works...
Please note that QwikMail SMTP is not a full mail system since it lacks a
major component, the ability to send mail to other sites without using an
external program such as the sendmail binary. But don't worry, it will
soon be, as the development of such a component is already under way.
